# lEdge
lEdge is something we all need. I always wanted to manage my money and analyse my income & expenses, but I never really got an app with all the required features. So, I thought of creating this app with all the features one needs to manage their money seamlessly. I hope you would love it.
<br/>lEdge provides features like Ledger, Charts, Pivot Tables, Statistics, Search, and Asset Management with live values of your assets like Metals and Securities.
